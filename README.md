This Repo contains some scientific papers that help solving manufacturing problems with data and AI . The notion of a new technolgy that can disrupt a manufacturing process is also delved upon.

A] Predictive Maintenance:  
1. The What, Why and How    
Predictive maintenance of assets is a technique where in the working conditions of the asset on the production floor are constantly monitored in real time. The conditions such as the electrical inputs to the motor, the current and the voltage , the temperature or pressure readings , the vibration of the rotating parts, etc  are done with the help of sensors. The new age assets may have the sensors in built and for the older ones may need retrofitting. Hence the system needs a synergy of data capture through sensors, data storage and data analysis. 
Once the real time data is in place, it is checked for its quality and is further preprocessed i.e aggregated, new features extracted etc
Next, a simple simple condition based monitoring(Threshold based) of assets is implemented(This is the most low hanging fruit). We then make the process more smarter taking it to the next level i.e  with the help of machine learning and deep learning models , the prediction of the working state of the assets is done. The models can predict the remaining useful life of the asset with the required accuracy, helping the maintenance managers to plan for the downtime and to have the least number of downtimes that have the minimal impact on the production schedules and quality of the finished product.

2. Further research    
   a) How do you decide on which assets in your production line will benefit with Predictive Maintenance?  
   b) What are some of the challenges that can be solved with the help of Generative AI?
